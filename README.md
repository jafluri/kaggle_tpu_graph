## Overview

This is the branch for the submission of the `tile` collection. 
Please follow the instructions of the main barch to install the dependencies and then feel free to explore. 
The repo here is a bit messy, but the tile collection does not require any special preparation. 
Models can be trained using the `training.py` script in the `scripts` folder.
