## Overview

This is the branch for the submission of the `layout:xla:default` collection. 
Please follow the instructions of the main barch to install the dependencies and then feel free to explore. 
Note that the repo here is in a messy state and there is no nice script like `add_features.py` to add the features to the dataset that makes it easy to train models.
